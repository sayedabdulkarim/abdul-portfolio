## 📊 Current Status

### What's Working ✅
- Full backend API with hybrid RAG + LLM pipeline
- Complete React chat UI with all components
- Dark theme matching design mockup
- Error handling and fallback responses

### What Needs Work 🚧
- Resume data extraction and structuring
- Model fine-tuning on personal data
- Backend deployment to cloud
- Production environment setup

### Blockers 🔴
- Need Replicate/HuggingFace API tokens
- Require Railway/Render account for deployment
- Resume PDF needs to be processed for training data
